# DONUT
Just another Tezos Wallet on mobile ( iOS first ) aim for minimalist design / functions.

### NOTE
- As my bot [@gonut_bot](https://t.me/gonut_bot) was built successfully with the [tezallet](https://github.com/thetrung/tezallet) library, I want to try making the mobile wallet for tezos on react native again, after last bad experience disaster with it.

- First test run commit demo seem to work like charm on simulator with `rn-nodeify` support, I will, instead migrating old designs into this, making a new one that focus on simplicity and just necessary functions to work first.

### FUNCTIONS
- Transfer balance (send/receive)
- Generate wallets with the same addresses to Temple/Kukai
- Secure wallet by encrypting mnemonic key w/ your password
- Get/Set Delegation 
- Tx History

That's all we need for a minimal wallet !
